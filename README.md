# Large_stack_prep 
Large_stack_prep is intended for internal use with 32bit ScanM implemented in Igor 6.37. You may run into issues where your imaging files are too large to load into the pre-existing analysis pipeline. This libary very simply contains functions to open the associated .smh and .smp files for pre-pre-processing. This consists exclusively of stripping down the trigger-containing channel (in our case, Ch2) such that approximately half of the storage is used. Thereby, it should be possible to open in memory due to conserving only half the data (while retaining the trigger information).
